\usage{
AFM.hhcf(
  obj,
  no = 1,
  numIterations = 10000,
  addFit = TRUE,
  dataOnly = FALSE,
  degRes = 100,
  r.percentage = 80,
  xi.percentage = 70,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{AFMdata object}

\item{no}{channel number}

\item{numIterations}{Number of iterations (must be > 1000), but 1e6 recommended}

\item{addFit}{if \code{TRUE} a fit is added to the data}

\item{dataOnly}{if \code{TRUE} returns data frame, otherwise returns a graph}

\item{degRes}{resolution of angle, the higher the better, should be >100, 1000 is also good, but takes more time}

\item{r.percentage}{a number from 10 to 100 representing the distance to compute, since the image is
square, there are not as many points that are separated by the full length, 80 is a good value, if there
is no fit, the value can be reduced to 70 or 60.}

\item{xi.percentage}{a number from 10 to 100 representing where correlation length could be found from maximum (used for fitting)}

\item{verbose}{output time if \code{TRUE}}
}
\value{
graph or data frame with g(r) and $num indicating number of computations used for r
}

must be encoded in a BMP file with a linear scale
